You should note that the qksvm folder, and the Projected_Quantum_Kernels.ipynb folder is from this github: https://github.com/DmitriiNabok/qksvm

We adapted the code to work for our own data.

Please also note for the files in qksvm folder to work, you need an older version of qiskit. Namely qiskit version 0.35.1.

And for the Quantum Variational Classifier.ipynb folder to work, you need the latest version of qiskit.

So both notebooks require different versions of qiskit to work unfortunately.
