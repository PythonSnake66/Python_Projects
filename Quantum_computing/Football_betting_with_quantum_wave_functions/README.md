# Quantum-Inspired Soccer Match Outcome Prediction

This project provides the framework with which one can employs a quantum physics to predict the outcomes of soccer matches, particularly beneficial for sports betting. The methodology combines quantum mechanics concepts, like wave functions and time evolution using Schrödinger's equation, with classical Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the probabilities of different match outcomes.

## Methodology

### 1. Wave Function Representation

The state of the system, which includes the positions of players and the ball, is represented as a wave function $\Psi(r_A, r_B, r_{\text{ball}}, t)$. This wave function is a product of individual Gaussian wave packets representing the probability amplitude of finding each player and the ball at a particular position at time $t$:

$$
\Psi(r_A, r_B, r_{\text{ball}}, t) = \psi_A(r_A, t) \cdot \psi_B(r_B, t) \cdot \psi_{\text{ball}}(r_{\text{ball}}, t)
$$

Each Gaussian wave packet, for example, for player A, can be represented as:

$$
\psi_A(r_A, t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp \left( -\frac{|r_A - r_{A,0}|^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)
$$

where $\sigma$ represents the spread of the wave packet, indicating the uncertainty in the player's position.

### 2. Time Evolution Using Schrödinger's Equation

The evolution of the wave function over time is governed by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation:

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = H \Psi
$$

The Hamiltonian $H$ consists of:

- **Kinetic Energy Terms**: Representing the movement of players and the ball. For a player A, this is given by:

$$
H_{\text{kinetic}, A} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_A} \nabla^2_A
$$

- **Potential Energy Terms**: Representing the interactions between players, and between players and the ball. For example, the interaction between players A and B can be represented as:

$$
V_{AB}(r_A, r_B) = k \frac{1}{|r_A - r_B|}
$$

The wave function is numerically evolved over a specified time span using classical methods (e.g., finite difference methods and numerical solvers such as `solve_ivp` in Python).

### 3. Monte Carlo Simulations

After evolving the wave function, Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate the likelihood of different match outcomes. The simulations sample from the probability density function given by $|\Psi|^2$ to determine the possible future states of the system. 

The probability of finding the system in a specific configuration (e.g., player A scoring a goal) is proportional to $|\Psi(r_A, r_B, r_{\text{ball}}, t)|^2$. The Monte Carlo approach uses many random samples to estimate the probabilities of different outcomes, such as:

- **Win for Team A**: When player A is in a favorable position.
- **Win for Team B**: When player B is in a favorable position.
- **Draw**: When neither team is in a clearly advantageous position.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Initialize the Quantum State**: Use Gaussian wave packets to define the initial state of the system based on the current positions of the players and the ball.
   
2. **Numerical Solution of Schrödinger's Equation**: Use Python libraries like `SciPy` to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for the wave function over the chosen time span.

3. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Perform Monte Carlo simulations using the evolved wave function to predict future match outcomes. The results are based on a large number of simulations to ensure accuracy.

4. **Visualization**: Visualize the probability density function of the evolved wave function to understand the distribution of likely configurations and match outcomes.
