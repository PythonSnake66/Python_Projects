# Quantum-Inspired Soccer Match Prediction

This project provides the framework for how one can utilize a quantum-inspired approach to predict the outcomes of soccer matches. The methodology combines the principles of quantum mechanics, such as wave functions and time evolution using Schrödinger's equation, with classical Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the probabilities of different match outcomes.

## Overview

### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to predict the win probabilities of a soccer match based on the current state of the game (positions of players and the ball) at a given time. The approach leverages quantum mechanics concepts to model the probabilistic nature of the game, evolving the game state over time and using Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the likelihood of various outcomes.

### Methodology

1. **Wave Function Representation:**
   - Each player's position and the ball's position are represented as Gaussian wave packets. The wave function for the entire system is the product of the individual wave functions of the players and the ball:
     \[
     \Psi(\mathbf{r}_A, \mathbf{r}_B, \mathbf{r}_{\text{ball}}, t) = \psi_A(\mathbf{r}_A, t) \cdot \psi_B(\mathbf{r}_B, t) \cdot \psi_{\text{ball}}(\mathbf{r}_{\text{ball}}, t)
     \]
   - The wave function encodes all possible configurations of the players and the ball on the field at a given time \( t \).

2. **Time Evolution Using Schrödinger's Equation:**
   - The time evolution of the wave function is governed by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation:
     \[
     i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = H \Psi
     \]
   - The Hamiltonian \( H \) consists of kinetic energy terms for the players and the ball, as well as potential energy terms representing their interactions.
   - The wave function is numerically evolved over a specified time span using classical methods (e.g., finite difference methods and numerical solvers like `solve_ivp`).

3. **Monte Carlo Simulations:**
   - The evolved wave function provides a probability distribution over possible configurations of the players and the ball.
   - Monte Carlo simulations are used to sample from this probability distribution, estimating the likelihood of different outcomes (e.g., win, loss, draw) based on the current state of the game.

### Key Components

- **Quantum State Preparation:**
  - The initial quantum state is prepared based on the current positions of the players and the ball, represented as Gaussian wave packets.

- **Hamiltonian Definition:**
  - The Hamiltonian captures the dynamics of the system, including kinetic energy (movement) and potential energy (interactions and field effects).

- **Time Evolution:**
  - The Schrödinger equation is solved numerically to evolve the wave function over a specified time span. This gives the state of the system at future times.

- **Outcome Estimation:**
  - Using the evolved wave function, Monte Carlo simulations estimate the probabilities of different match outcomes by sampling from the probability density function given by \(|\Psi|^2\).

### Practical Implementation

1. **Define Initial State:**
   - Initialize the wave function using Gaussian packets based on the given positions of players and the ball.

2. **Numerical Solution of Schrödinger's Equation:**
   - Use Python libraries such as `scipy` to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for the wave function over the chosen time span.

3. **Run Monte Carlo Simulations:**
   - Perform Monte Carlo simulations using the evolved wave function to predict future match outcomes. The results are based on a large number of simulations to ensure accuracy.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Visualize the probability density function of the evolved wave function to understand the distribution of likely configurations and match outcomes.

### Advantages of the Quantum-Inspired Approach

- **Probabilistic Modeling:**
  - The wave function provides a natural framework for modeling the probabilistic nature of soccer match dynamics.
  
- **Dynamic Predictions:**
  - By evolving the wave function over time, the approach provides dynamic predictions that can be updated as the game progresses.

- **Monte Carlo Simulations:**
  - Using Monte Carlo simulations allows for efficient estimation of outcome probabilities, leveraging the probabilistic nature of the evolved quantum state.

### Future Extensions

- **Refinement of Hamiltonian:**
  - Incorporate more realistic potential energy terms to better capture interactions between players and with the ball.

- **Integration with Real-Time Data:**
  - Update the wave function and predictions in real-time using live data from matches.

- **Quantum Computing:**
  - Explore the use of actual quantum computing frameworks (e.g., Qiskit) for further optimization and scalability.
